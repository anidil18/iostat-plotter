The `iostat_plotter` by Jeffrey B. Layton is a tool for plotting data gathered
by iostat. It generates a report in HTML format. More info:

 - `<http://clusterbuffer.wordpress.com/file-system-tools/iostat_plot/iostat-plotter-v3/>`_

Because there doesn't seem to exist any public repo of it yet (just `this dropbox link`_).
